This game will be about managing a group of survivors when society ceases to function on Earth.
The player will start a few days before the 'apocalypse'. They will have an opportunity to get to know
and recruit some people into their group. Having too big of a party means problems with transportation 
and food. Going alone is a deathwish.
The characters in the game are not special forces; they are ordinary civilians with different backgrounds,
skillsets, fears and motivations. It is possible to have pets in the game.
After making an initial survival plan, the group sets out to travel to a safe(r) place.
They will have to secure food and water, a vehicle big enough for them, weapons or tools to survive.
During their travels, many decisions will have to be made. For example, whether to accept a stranger to 
their group, or whether to raid a supermarket that might already be looted, or guarded.
Gameplay will be in a few different modes:
  Vehicle mode:
    The members of the party fill up the roles in travelling with a car or RV: 
      1. Driver, only focuses on the road
      2. Navigator, making strategic decisions
      3. Scout/Gunner
      4. Scout/Gunner
    The player starts out as the Navigator, but can take other characters' places at will, with a 
    single button press. Whenever switching, an AI takes up the control of the previous character.
  Looting mode:
    The group has to pick up the most amount of useful loot, taking into consideration their inventory
    space (bags, pockets and backpacks) while keeping a lookout for others and leaving ASAP.
  Base building mode:
    The player can try to settle down once they think they've found a safe enough place.
    The RV also counts as a base. In this mode, buildings and modifications can be placed, if there are 
    enough resources.

The game will feature an overhead camera and lowpoly graphics and selfmade music.
The game will have some polished game mechanics, including:
  Complex steps where ordering matters, e.g. cauterizing a wound or mixing chemicals
    The steps will be provided on some form of note to the player, that is not visible while doing the task.
  Different keypresses for different actions, like opening a car door, or turning the key
    A prompt will appear with the correct key after a few seconds, rewarding players that remember it.
  Interactive actions like lockpicking, repairing, weapon cleaning
    Stuff like holding the mouse button down and making circular motions.

The game will feature character creation on the main character, with some questions to set up the background
and childhood. It will be possible to choose positive perks, but for each one of them a random negative perk will 
also be applied. There will be optional traits with both negative and positive effects.

The choices made will include conversation choices, the composition of the squad, travel destination choices, 
and different ways to resolve scenarios. Scenarios will be random events that happen while travelling with 
multiple outcomes. The game will have an overarching story with a few different endings, and partly random-generated
scenario content in the middle. The importance of choices will not be communicated to the player; they should be 
paranoid and treat every decision with the same weight. Some of them will have no consequences.
